# Web-Scraping
### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python. The goal is to extract data from websites and store it in a structured format (such as CSV or JSON) for further analysis. Web scraping is a technique used to extract information from websites by parsing HTML and using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas.

### Libraries Used
- `requests` – To send HTTP requests to web pages.
- `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`) – To parse and extract data from HTML documents.
- `pandas` – To structure and save data in a clean format like CSV or JSON.
- `numpy` – For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - For visualization.
